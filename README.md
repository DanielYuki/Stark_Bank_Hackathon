# Stark Loan App Info:
The Stark Loan App was developed as part of a hackathon organized by Stark Bank specifically for ITA students.

## Objectives:
Our primary objective was to implement an intelligent loan system that rates the loan proposals based on multiple data and by an AI market tendency evaluation.

## Useful Information:
### Quick and easy:
We just need to collected essential information, like: company name, CNPJ/CPF (tax identification number), email, address, number of employees, age of the company, company segment and required loan amount, for instance.

### Information Treatment:
The data provided by clients served multiple purposes, including contact purposes, generating future payment slips (boletos), preparing future contracts, and conducting a pre-analysis evaluation.

### AI Judgment:
For the initial evaluation, we leveraged an AI feature that analyze the client's goals. This facilitated a better understanding of whether their project is feasible or not, streamlining the decision-making process.

### Neural Network:
In addition, we found great value in implementing a neural network-based points criteria. This allowed us to establish a systematic evaluation process, considering various factors and enabling more accurate and efficient loan assessments.

By incorporating AI judgment and a neural network-based evaluation system, our Stark Loan App became a powerful tool, providing intelligent and data-driven loan decisions for our clients.
